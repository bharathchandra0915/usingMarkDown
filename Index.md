### Creating checkbox
- [x] Start camera using ` cv2.videoCapture(0) `. 0 is for the default camera of your system. Use 1 if you have an external webcam.
- [ ] Run a while loop 
- [ ] display the captured frame using 'cv2.imshow()`
- [ ]  `(cv2.waitKey(1))`  waits for 1 millisecond until the next frame is shown.
Fill the ` [ ] ` with `x` to tick the checkbox.
